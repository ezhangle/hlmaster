	* Limited number of servers loadable by --server-list
	  to 3'000.
	* Servers loaded via --server-list are getting checked
	  in a bunch of 100 servers every 10 seconds. If you
	  load a lot of servers, it'll take a while until they
	  get checked (max 5 minutes).


2001-11-01  Silvan Minghetti  <bullet@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Send a details request instead of a ping request to
	  servers loaded by --server-list.

	* Randomized the challenge number in HLMaster to prevent
	  denial of service with spoofed ip's.
	* Moved the challenge string parsing logic into the
	  HLMaster class.
	* Challenge infos changed a bit with hl version 1.1.0.8:
	   - Old: \dedicated\1

	* Hosts replying with an invalid challenge id are
	  now rejected to prevent flooding with spoofed ip's.


2001-10-30  Silvan Minghetti  <bullet@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ServerList and FilterList Load functions now return
	  the number of successfully loaded servers instead
	  of true/false.


2001-10-29  Silvan Minghetti  <bullet@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Added basic (no filtering) support for the Half-Life
	  ingame browser.
	* Fixed a bug concerning gamespy. If the list had more
	  than 230 entries, gamespy did not display any of them.
	* Changed #ifdef __linux__ to PFC_SYSTEM_UNIX - which in
	  fact checks for __linux__, __FreeBSD__, __NetBSD__.


2001-07-04  Silvan Minghetti  <bullet@users.sourceforge.net>

	* The custom servername (--server-name) is now allways
	  prefixed by "HLMaster 0.9.2 - ".
	* List type2 request was broken (returned bad index, only
	  occured with more than about 340 servers).

	* Split input processing (ProcessInput) into multiple
	  functions. (HLMaster.cpp)
	* Select is now performed on the Socket object directly,
	  instead of requireing a PFileDescriptor object. The
	  PFileDescriptor class might be a subject to drop completly.
	* Gameservers which send a hearbeat but do not respond
	  to the challenge request wont be listed by list requests.
	  They are not deleted, because they're still heartbeating.


2001-06-23  Silvan Minghetti  <bullet@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Tabs in the --server-list are now accepted.
	* Changed some argument names (--host-list to --server-list,
	  --server-name to --master-name, ...).


2001-06-22  Silvan Minghetti  <bullet@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Removed --error-log. All errors are now reported
	  within the --info-log.
	* Added --host-list. You can now load a list of hosts
	  instead of waiting for them to send a heartbeat.
	* Added --private-mode. If you load hosts, you may
	  go into private mode. This adds ban filter for all
	  hosts, so only the ones in your host-list are accepted.
	* The access-log now does not use the log-level value
	  specified with --log-level. It's allways on level "Info".
	* Invalid queries are logged only with log-level "Debug".
