hlmaster.filter(1)         User Manual         hlmaster.filter(1)



<b>NAME</b>
       <b>hlmaster.filter</b> - How to allow/block specific gameservers.


<b>DESCRIPTION</b>
       This document describes, how the config-file has  to  look
       like,  for  loading into <b>hlmaster</b> with the <b>--server-filter</b>
       argument.

       These filter rules allow you, to allow/deny specific game-
       servers and as well complete networks.
       You  can  however  not  ban a gameserver upon his port. At
       least one ip-address is filtered.

       Please note, that server filtering  has  not  been  tested
       through and through yet.


<b>COMMANDS</b>
       Commands are case-sensitive, so enshure you write them all
       in lowercase and only one command per line.

       The following commands are used to  configure  some  basic
       settings:

       <b>default</b> <i>allow</i> <b>|</b> <i>deny</i>
              This  sets the default behaviour, what to do, if no
              specific filter rule could be found.
              If you  ommit  this  default  rule,  <i>deny</i>  will  be
              applied.

       <b>order</b> <i>allow</i> <b>|</b> <i>deny</i>
              This  determines,  if  a deny rule takes precedence
              over an allow rule and vice versa.


       Now, the commands used to deny/allow hosts/networks:

            <b>allow</b> <i>ip-address</i> <b>[</b> <i>netmask</i> <b>]</b>
            <b>deny</b>  <i>ip-address</i> <b>[</b> <i>netmask</i> <b>]</b>


       This will allow or  deny  the  host  given  by  <i>ip-address</i>
       (hostnames  are  not  allowed).   If  no <i>netmask</i> is given,
       255.255.255.255 is assumed - wich  leads  to  filtering  a
       single host. And this is normally exactly what you want.
       I'm  not  going to describe netmasks any further, you will
       never need them anyway...

       Comments are also allowed and initiated with the  familiar
       '#'  sign.  They may begin everywhere in a line and remain
       active until the end of line.

       Look at the SIGNALS section in the <b><a href="./hlmaster.html">hlmaster</a></b>(1) manpage for
       instructions  on  reloading the filters, while hlmaster is
       running.


<b>EXAMPLES</b>
       An example <i>filter.list</i> is  provided  within  the  examples
       directory  of  the  source distribution. However, here's a
       short example:

            # example hlmaster filter list

            order deny
            default allow

            # aaa swiss counterstrike
            allow     194.209.69.205

            # some sux0rz
            deny 123.123.123.123
            deny 194.216.124.21

            # localhost network
            deny 127.0.0.0 255.0.0.0
