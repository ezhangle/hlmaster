<b>NAME</b>
       <b>hlmaster.list</b>  - How to load your own list of gameservers.


<b>DESCRIPTION</b>
       This document describes, how the config-file has  to  look
       like,  for  loading  into  <b>hlmaster</b> with the <b>--server-list</b>
       argument.
       You might also want to start <b>hlmaster</b>  with  the  <b>--closed</b>
       argument. See <b><a href="./hlmaster.html">hlmaster</a></b>(1) for more information.

       Create  an  empty  text-file and insert one gameserver per
       line with the following syntax:

            <i>type</i> <i>ip-address</i> <i>port</i>

       Please note that you cannot pass  a  hostname,  you  abso-
       lutely have to give <b>hlmaster</b> an <i>ip-address</i>.
       The <i>port</i> however is not required (27015 is presumed then).
       The <i>ip-address</i> and the <i>port</i> have to be separated by a  ':'
       or  by at least one space/tab character. Servers loaded by
       --server-list are limited to 3000. The overall limit  with
       dynamically added servers is 60000.

       The <i>type</i> definition has to be passed in front of the host,
       but you may optionally ommit it completly (check is  taken
       by default).

       <b>Available</b> <b>types:</b>

       <b>check</b>  The  gameservers  loaded from your list do not send
              heartbeats. To prevent your list of containing dead
              servers,  this options turns on pinging the servers
              every five minutes. This is also the default, if no
              type was specified.
              Note:   <b>hlmaster</b>   automagically  converts  servers
              marked as <b>check</b> to  'dynamic'  upon  receipt  of  a
              heartbeat/challenge  and  thereby  removes  them if
              they stop sending beats.

       <b>nocheck</b>
              Servers marked with <b>nocheck</b> will  never  time  out!
              They  will  remain  in  the  list, even if they are
              dead. This option actually should not be used.
              Note: <b>hlmaster</b> does  not  convert  <b>nocheck</b>  servers
              upon receipt of a heartbeat.


       Note: Case is not ignored! Enshure you write the type def-
       inition in lowercase.

       Comments are also allowed and initiated with the  familiar
       '#'  sign.  They may begin everywhere in a line and remain
       active until the end of line.

       Look at the SIGNALS section in the <b><a href="./hlmaster.html">hlmaster</a></b>(1) manpage for
       instructions  on  reloading the filters, while hlmaster is
       running.


<b>EXAMPLES</b>
       An example <i>server.list</i> is  provided  within  the  examples
       directory  of  the  source distribution. However, here's a
       short example:

            # example hlmaster gameserver list

            # aaa swiss counterstrike
            check     194.209.69.205:27015

            # l33t s3rv3r, n3v3r d0wn
            nocheck   194.209.69.205:27020

            # some other servers
            123.123.123.123     27015
            234.234.234.234     27015
