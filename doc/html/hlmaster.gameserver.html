<b>NAME</b>
       <b>hlmaster.gameserver</b>  - How to configure your gameserver to
       send heartbeats to hlmaster.


<b>DESCRIPTION</b>
       If  you  want   to   get   your   gameserver   dynamically
       added/removed  from your master-server, you'll have to add
       an entry into the file <i>woncomm.lst</i>.  This file is  located
       within  the gameservers mod directory (eg. valve, cstrike,
       tfc...).
       There might be no <i>woncomm.lst</i> in  a  mods  directory,  but
       that  doesnt  really  matter.  You can either copy the one
       found in the valve directory, or just leave it  there  and
       edit  it.  If Half-Life does not find a <i>woncomm.lst</i> in the
       mod's directory, it defaults to using the one found in the
       valve directory.

       After  editing  your <i>woncomm.lst</i>, it's required to restart
       your gameserver for the changes to take effect. To verify,
       your  gameserver is really sending heartbeats to your mas-
       ter, you can go to the Half-Life console and  enter  <i>'set-</i>
       <i>master'</i> - respectivly <i>'rcon</i> <i>setmaster'</i>.
       You  should  now  get  a lists of the currently configured
       master-servers. You can also add  a  master-server,  while
       half-life  is  running.  This is performed with <i>'setmaster</i>
       <i>add</i> <b>ip</b> <b>port'</b> - where <b>ip</b> is your master server's ip-address
       (eg.  194.209.69.205)  and  <b>port</b> is it's port-number (nor-
       mally 27010).

       NOTE: Configuration changes made with the  setmaster  com-
       mand  only  remain  active  till next gameserver shutdown.
       Therefore, you'll have to edit your <i>woncomm.lst</i> anyway.


<b>EXAMPLES</b>
       An example <i>woncomm.lst</i> is  provided  within  the  examples
       directory  of  the  source distribution. However, here's a
       short example of the master section:

            Master
            {
                 <b>your.server.com:27010</b>
                 half-life.east.won.net:27010
                 half-life.west.won.net:27010
                 half-life.central.won.net:27010
            }
