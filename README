HLMaster readme               last updated Saturday, 22. December 2001



Function and purpose ::...............................................
----------------------------------------------------------------------

	HLMaster implements a fully functional, automatic master-server
	daemon for the game Half-life (and all mods based on this engine).

	Because the master-server protocol is not open, I had to figure
	it out myself. Some features might not be implemented, some may
	be 'wrong'. However, all basically required features should work.

	I have tested hlmaster with the following query-tools:
	
	  o GameSpy  - http://www.gamespy.com
	  o QStat    - http://www.qstat.org


	If you encounter any problems with any query tool, please
	send an e-mail to bullet@users.sourceforge.net.

	Note: Current versions of gamespy are incapable of receiving more
	      than 230 gameservers from hlmaster. This limitation comes
	      from GameSpy, not hlmaster (GameSpy is using an old protocol).

	Check http://hlmaster.sourceforge.net for newest version.


Documentation ::......................................................
----------------------------------------------------------------------

	Documentation is provided within the 'doc' directory. On Linux,
	the manfiles are installed by 'make install' as well.
	
	Additionally, there is an html version of the manfiles in the
	doc/html directory.

	Please note: The documentation might not allways be up to date.
